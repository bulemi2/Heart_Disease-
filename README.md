# Predicting Coronary Heart Disease (CHD)

# overview

Cardiovascular diseases stand as a leading global cause of death, claiming approximately 17.9 million lives annually and placing a substantial strain on public health systems (World Health Organization, 2023). Key contributors to heart diseases include factors related to metabolism, behavior, environment, and social conditions. The World Health Organization emphasizes the pivotal role of timely and accurate prediction in enhancing patient outcomes and efficiently managing healthcare resources. The spectrum of cardiovascular diseases encompasses four primary types: coronary heart disease, stroke, peripheral arterial disease, and aortic disease (National Health Service, 2023).

# problem statement
The increasing prevalence of heart diseases, a prominent cause of premature mortality globally, is attributed to rising behavioral risk factors like unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, tobacco use, and excessive alcohol consumption. These behaviors manifest in individuals as elevated blood pressure, increased blood glucose, raised blood lipids, and obesity. Recognizing these "intermediate risk factors" is crucial in primary care settings as they signal heightened susceptibility to heart-related complications. Notably, 4 out of 5 heart disease-related deaths occur prematurely, impacting individuals under 70 years. However, positive modifications in behavioral factors have demonstrated the potential to mitigate heart disease risk. In this project, leveraging a dataset encompassing parameters such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other pertinent medical indicators, our objective is to construct predictive models adept at identifying individuals with an elevated risk of developing heart-related complications.

# objectives
* Uncover meaningful patterns and risk factors associated with heart disease, enabling targeted preventive measures and personalized treatment plans

* Assist healthcare professionals in early detection and proactive management of coronary heart disease.

* Create Machine Learning-based predictive models that can show likelihood of an individual developing CHD in 10 years time for use by phyisicians in targeting individuals for prioritized prevetantive interventions

# Recommendations
1. Identification and Prioritization of High-Risk Patients:
Recognize the pivotal role of age, systolic blood pressure, prevalent hypertension, and diastolic blood pressure in predicting heart disease.

2. Age-Specific Focus:
Prioritize the 40-59 age group for targeted interventions, as they are most susceptible to heart disease.

3. Weight Management and Heart Health:
Provide tailored guidance for individuals falling within the overweight category, highlighting the higher likelihood of heart disease compared to those with normal weight, underweight, or obese individuals

4. Comprehensive Risk Assessment:
Encourage healthcare professionals to conduct a thorough evaluation of patients, taking into account multiple risk factors such as age, blood pressure, and weight status.
